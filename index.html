Probably a mall called North Park mall and...I used to go there with my friends in Middle School cuz' we would hang out at the mall, cuz' that's what we did in 2003. No, no 2003-2004...is it Middle School or High School? it might be 2005...I created an archive of that year...So, I bought them at the mall...I don't remember buying them, I remember wearing them and drawing on them...is like kind of feminine, you know..now that I look at them...that was drawn on everything, that star...my best friend would draw them everywhere and I think I was trying to copy her...I thought she was really cool...I also had a huge crush on her</p></div>
