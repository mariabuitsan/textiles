    <div class="etno-notes"><h4>The following excerpts are from an interview with the owner of the jeans, who has kept them for over 20 years, accompanied by photos of the Atacama Desert in Chile, details of her jeans, and stills from The Taste of Cherry (1998) by Abbas Kiarostami. I want to bring all these elements together to reflect on the complex, contaminated landscapes in which we are deeply immersed. Our consumption patterns, decisions, subjectivities, and identities play a role in production and waste. But also in reusing, archiving, and upcycling the fabrics of our lives. Could a view on humans as already-by-default contaminated and agents of contamination shift something in our psyches and behaviors towards a sense of deeper care for others and everything else? Could we engage in the creation and production of ourselves in ways that are not mediated by consumption? Could we do personal degrowth? </h4></div>
